# Project idea

In SÃ£o Paulo cine Belas Artes, there's a special event that happens monthly, called "Belas Sonoriza", in which they play a movie with live soundtrack.

However, the tickets run out incredibly fast and I never get the chance to watch. So, I'm gonna try to automate this process:

* Checking if this month's event was already released
* Create an e-mail alert so I can purchase as fast as possible


## Limitations and next steps
In an ideal world, the automation would also purchase the ticket for me, but that would include dealing with personal financial information and probably some CAPTCHA checks and I don't know if I can automate this safely. If anyone knows how to do it, please feel free to  PR ou send me a message.
